Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Stripe project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings
Main React functionalities I learned: responsive navbar, sidebar for mobile display, navbar with dropdown submenu funcionality, dynamic styling, useRef. I made my own setup and styling, with a mobile first approach.
